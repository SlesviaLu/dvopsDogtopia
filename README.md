# dvopsDogtopia
DVOPS Dogtopia Project
For this project, my team and I are  tasked to create a application utilizing standard continuous integration and delivery techniques,
such as Version Control using Source Code Management tools. 
The web application that my team has chosen is a dog review web application where users can view, read, edit and delete reviews about different breeds of dogs.
This web application is done in Eclipse IDE using jsp and css.
